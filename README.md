# some sort of text thing

So, it works.

## TODO:
- ~~DONE extract text from poeticalbot~~
- colors
- change-it-up (I have no idea what I'm talking about)
- better engine, Rita?
- modern ui and all of that
- text input s/b easier - a popup, or something
- get rid of jquery
- PWA or Vue or something (uh, a bit much, perhaps.)


## weird thoughts

- what if there was an image?

## colors
